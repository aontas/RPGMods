# XPRising

This is a revitalisation of RPGMods. It has similar core ideas, with some reduced config complexity, looking to upgrade into the future.

## XPRising update for V Rising 1.0

Initial release for 1.0 current in testing. Check the releases page for recent (pre-release) versions.

### XPRising Requirements

- [BepInExPack V Rising](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_V_Rising/) (Server)
- [VampireCommandFramework](https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/deca/VampireCommandFramework/) (Server)

## Documentation

- [ChangeLog](CHANGELOG.md)
- [Command list](Command.md): A full list of commands (when all the systems are configured to be on) can be found here.
- [System documentation](Documentation.md): Each of the systems has some further documentation on this link. It is worth noting that
while both the weapon and bloodline mastery systems are intended to provide bonus stats, this is a work in progress and they don't actually provide anything yet.
