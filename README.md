# XPRising

> This is a revitalisation of RPGMods. It has the same core ideas, with some reduced config complexity, looking to upgrade into the future.

# XPRising Update for 1.0

> Following the release of Gloomrot by Stunlock Studios for V Rising, the original RPG mod became incompatible, requiring extensive code updates. Now, the mod is in a mostly working state, looking to bring more features up as we go.

# XPRising Requirements

# By the community, for the community

> It was crucial for us to keep the code open source to ensure excellent support and provide other mod developers the opportunity to develop plugins for XPRising at any time. This project is free and open to everyone, created by the community for the community, and everyone is a part of the development!
