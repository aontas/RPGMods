### Units stats and their effects in V Rising
The following effects will be applied at 100% mastery. This is some initial investigation, any additional results that you find and can provide will be added to the table.

Note that different weapons will have different damage coefficients. All the damage bonus stats in the table are not normalised, but do seem to work to add some additional damage. Further investigation is required.
